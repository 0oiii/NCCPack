This is a basic chat script that allows members to change their names within the chat without changing their Steam/FiveM names.
As well as this members are able to choose their departments and it will be presented in chat next to their names.

Please see the list below for all the commands within this script:
/name - Allows members to enter a firstname and a lastname.
/department - Allows members to select a department from the following; SO (BCSO, HP (SAHP), PD (LSPD), FD (LSFD), Civ (Civ).
/twthandle - Allows members to create an custom Twotter/Twitter handle.
/twt - Allows members to send a global message to other members on the server using Twotter/Twitter (Global)
/me - Allows members to send messages over chat (Proximity)
/mer - Allows members to send a message over chat that appears in RED (Proximity)
/ooc - Allows members to send an "Out of Character" (OOC) message (Proximity)
/gooc Allows members to send an "Out of Character" (OOC) message (Global)
/dw - Allows members to send an Anonymous message (Global)

In the list above, some of the commands are proximity based. This means that only people who are within 20* in game meters will see the message.
